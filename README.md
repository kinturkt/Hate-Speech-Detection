# Hate-Speech-Detection
-> Hate speech is detected across a variety of online platforms, prominent social media networks, forums, and website comment sections are among the most frequent locations. <br>
-> One of the most popular platforms with the highest concentration of hate speech is Twitter. <br>
-> Therefore, we are using the Twitter dataset for this project to detect hate speech. <br>
-> I have used 2 models for model training: A) LSTM- Long Short-Term Memory    <br>
                                            B) BERT- Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers <br>
-> Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture specifically designed to address the limitations of traditional RNNs, particularly in handling long-term dependencies. <br>
-> BERT's novel architecture and training approach enable it to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks without task-specific architecture modifications. <br>
